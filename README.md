Where the Nucleo code lives or something.

## Compiling

1. Install the requisite build system (`cmake`) and `opencv` (so we can link against it) if they are not already available.
2. Use `cmake .` to generate the build files for the project.
3. Use whatever build system is typical of your environment to compile the code. On Linux, just type `make`.
